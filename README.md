## Setup & Installation

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run

### Task 1: Code Completion
Run the Python script to see the performance comparison:
```bash
python Part2_Task1_CodeCompletion.py
```

### Task 2: Automated Testing
Run the Selenium script (requires Chrome):
```bash
python Part2_Task2_AutomatedTesting.py
```
*Note: This will open a browser window, perform the tests, and save screenshots.*

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Part2_Task3_PredictiveAnalytics.ipynb
```
Run all cells to generate the dataset, train the model, and view the evaluation metrics.
